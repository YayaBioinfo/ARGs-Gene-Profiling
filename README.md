# ARGs-Gene-Profiling
A bioinformatics workflow for profiling antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) using sequencing data to characterize resistance gene diversity and abundance in microbial communities.


## 🧰 Tools & Databases

- **DIAMOND**  
  Fast protein aligner for large-scale metagenomic data.

- **CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database)**  
  Curated antibiotic resistance gene resource organized with Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), providing reference sequences in FASTA and other formats for use with DIAMOND alignments. 

Download CARD data from: https://card.mcmaster.ca/download  
Index the CARD FASTA for DIAMOND prior to profiling.
